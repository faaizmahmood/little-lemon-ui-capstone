# 🍋 Little Lemon Restaurant Reservation App - Meta Capstone Project

## 📌 Introduction
This project is part of the **Meta Front-End Developer Capstone** on Coursera. It showcases my skills as a front-end developer by building a responsive and accessible restaurant reservation web app using **React.js**, based on a fictional brand called *Little Lemon*.

It’s a key addition to my portfolio, demonstrating my ability to turn design concepts into functional, user-focused interfaces — with real-world development techniques, API integrations, and UX principles.
